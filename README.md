# Automatic Portable Irrigation System
This automatic watering system was developed and manufactured as my final thesis in Mechatronics at the VÃµru County Vocational Education Center.
This system consists of two main parts: 
1. Water distribution system
2. Controller
All parts are placed in a common housing to ensure easy installation and transportation of the system.
