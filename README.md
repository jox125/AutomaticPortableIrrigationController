# Automatic Portable Irrigation System

This automatic watering system was developed and manufactured as my final thesis in Mechatronics at the VÃµru County Vocational Education Center.
In this repository you find two main parts: 
1. Water distribution system hardware overview
2. Controller software

All parts are placed in a common housing to ensure easy installation and transportation of the system.
